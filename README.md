# max_gibberwocky_package
gibberwocky provides gibber-style live coding controlling Max/MSP/Jitter and Gen. Easily create looping sequences, transform patterns over time, and dynamically create Gen synthesizers and modulation graphs using a JavaScript client that runs in the browser.

## Installing

Download the package and place into your Max Packages folder. (On Windows, ```My Documents/Max 7/Packages```, on Mac, ```~/Documents/Max 7/Packages```), then restart Max.

Once installed, simply create the object `[gibberwocky]` and then open the associated help file to get started. 
gibberwocky should also be available via the Max package manager in the near future (5/16/2017).

## Reference

[http://gibberwocky.cc/reference/](http://gibberwocky.cc/reference/)

Note that this is a reference for all three gibberwocky systems (gibberwocky.live, gibberwocky.max, and gibberwocky.midi); they share many objects in common in addition to having their own unique affordances.

## More help
Outside of the Max help patcher, there are a bunch of included tutorials in the browser-interface to get you started using gibberwocky.
