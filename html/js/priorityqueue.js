 *
 * This implementation is very loosely based off js-priority-queue
 * by Adam Hooper from https://github.com/adamhooper/js-priority-queue
 *
 * The js-priority-queue implementation seemed a teensy bit bloated
 * with its require.js dependency and multiple storage strategies
 * when all but one were strongly discouraged. So here is a kind of
 * condensed version of the functionality with only the features that
 * I particularly needed.
 *
 * Using it is pretty simple, you just create an instance of HeapQueue
 * while optionally specifying a comparator as the argument:
 *
 * var heapq = new HeapQueue();
 *
 * var customq = new HeapQueue(function(a, b){
 *   // if b > a, return negative
 *   // means that it spits out the smallest item first
 *   return a - b;
 * });
 *
 * Note that in this case, the default comparator is identical to
 * the comparator which is used explicitly in the second queue.
 *
 * Once you've initialized the heapqueue, you can plop some new
 * elements into the queue with the push method (vaguely reminiscent
 * of typical javascript arays)
 *
 * heapq.push(42);
 * heapq.push("kitten");
 *
 * The push method returns the new number of elements of the queue.
 *
 * You can push anything you'd like onto the queue, so long as your
 * comparator function is capable of handling it. The default
 * comparator is really stupid so it won't be able to handle anything
 * other than an number by default.
 *
 * You can preview the smallest item by using peek.
 *
 * heapq.push(-9999);
 * heapq.peek(); // ==> -9999
 *
 * The useful complement to to the push method is the pop method,
 * which returns the smallest item and then removes it from the
 * queue.
 *
 * heapq.push(1);
 * heapq.push(2);
 * heapq.push(3);
 * heapq.pop(); // ==> 1
 * heapq.pop(); // ==> 2
 * heapq.pop(); // ==> 3
